## HW4 Named Entity Recognition using LSTMs

Performed Named Entity Recognition on text (CoNLL-2003) by following the below steps:

- Data Preparation
- GloVe Feature Extraction
- Applying LSTMs:
  - Bi-LSTMs with learned embeddings
  - Bi-LSTMs with GloVe embeddings
  - LSTM-CNN with GloVe embeddings
